      "\tTwenty six years ago, 30 artists took part in an art festival. They would have hoped but may not have believed that this festival would lead to domestic and international recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLittle did they know that the same art festival would become one of the biggest and most celebrated art festivals in Sri Lanka. What started with just 30 artists has now increased to a number greater than 350. This art festival is what we now know to be Kala Pola.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe vibrant, colourful art festival, Kala Pola will return for its 26th run on February 24 at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha from 8am to 9pm. It is Sri Lanka’s biggest open art fair and provides a platform for aspiring and established artists to share,market and network themselves and their craft to local and international audiences; in 2018, there were 28,000 visitors and more than Rs.15 million worth of artworks were sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn the past, artists would be forced to book a gallery themselves and hold an exhibition to gain recognition. However, most of the time this was simply an additional financial burden and the artist would rarely gain any recognition as most visitors would simply be family and friends. Today at Kala Pola, it only costs Rs. 1000 to reserve a stall making it an affordable venture to display art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2019 marks 25 years of partnership between the George Keyt Foundation and John Keells Group to hold the Kala Pola annually. Representing the two organisations at a panel discussion on February 6, were Chairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings Nadija Tambiah, Vice President of John Keells Holdings Dileep Mudadeniya, artists Sudath Abeysekera and Zamshiya Kaleel. The discussion was moderated by Arun Dias Bandaranaike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tChairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, believes that Kala Pola has created a market for art in Sri Lanka and is now a ‘great launching pad for artists’.This is evident from the many artists who have gone on to gain international recognition. Sudath Abeysekera is one of artists whose art is now displayed in Bangladesh and India through the exposure he has received. He has participated in Kala Pola for 15 years and does not intend to stop as he says he has great respect for the event which has helped make him a full time artist. This thought has been reiterated by Zamshiya Kaleel who is also a veteran participant. She expressed her gratitude for the organisers as this was her way of making a living. The exposure and interest garnered through the fair has enabled her to do what she loves whilst providing for her family. Sh says, ‘we would eagerly await the day when the next Kala Pola was announced every year.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\tKala Pola has continued to evolve and is no longer simply a place to display and buy art; it has now also become a place of learning. Many schools and art students visit Kala Pola and talk to artists to further their understanding of how to create great artwork. There will also be a kids corner for children to tap into their creative side. This is a very positive development and one which Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings PLC, Nadija Tambiah, strongly supports as she believes that ‘the development of art is fundamental to the development of our culture’.\n",

      "\tWith no entrance fee, Kala Pola 2019 is expected to demonstrate the best of Sri Lankan art for everyone to experience and enjoy.\n",

      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tTwenty six years ago, 30 artists took part in an art festival. They would have hoped but may not have believed that this festival would lead to domestic and international recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLittle did they know that the same art festival would become one of the biggest and most celebrated art festivals in Sri Lanka. What started with just 30 artists has now increased to a number greater than 350. This art festival is what we now know to be Kala Pola.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe vibrant, colourful art festival, Kala Pola will return for its 26th run on February 24 at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha from 8am to 9pm. It is Sri Lanka’s biggest open art fair and provides a platform for aspiring and established artists to share,market and network themselves and their craft to local and international audiences; in 2018, there were 28,000 visitors and more than Rs.15 million worth of artworks were sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn the past, artists would be forced to book a gallery themselves and hold an exhibition to gain recognition. However, most of the time this was simply an additional financial burden and the artist would rarely gain any recognition as most visitors would simply be family and friends. Today at Kala Pola, it only costs Rs. 1000 to reserve a stall making it an affordable venture to display art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2019 marks 25 years of partnership between the George Keyt Foundation and John Keells Group to hold the Kala Pola annually. Representing the two organisations at a panel discussion on February 6, were Chairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings Nadija Tambiah, Vice President of John Keells Holdings Dileep Mudadeniya, artists Sudath Abeysekera and Zamshiya Kaleel. The discussion was moderated by Arun Dias Bandaranaike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tChairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, believes that Kala Pola has created a market for art in Sri Lanka and is now a ‘great launching pad for artists’.This is evident from the many artists who have gone on to gain international recognition. Sudath Abeysekera is one of artists whose art is now displayed in Bangladesh and India through the exposure he has received. He has participated in Kala Pola for 15 years and does not intend to stop as he says he has great respect for the event which has helped make him a full time artist. This thought has been reiterated by Zamshiya Kaleel who is also a veteran participant. She expressed her gratitude for the organisers as this was her way of making a living. The exposure and interest garnered through the fair has enabled her to do what she loves whilst providing for her family. Sh says, ‘we would eagerly await the day when the next Kala Pola was announced every year.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\tKala Pola has continued to evolve and is no longer simply a place to display and buy art; it has now also become a place of learning. Many schools and art students visit Kala Pola and talk to artists to further their understanding of how to create great artwork. There will also be a kids corner for children to tap into their creative side. This is a very positive development and one which Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings PLC, Nadija Tambiah, strongly supports as she believes that ‘the development of art is fundamental to the development of our culture’.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWith no entrance fee, Kala Pola 2019 is expected to demonstrate the best of Sri Lankan art for everyone to experience and enjoy.\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tTwenty six years ago, 30 artists took part in an art festival. They would have hoped but may not have believed that this festival would lead to domestic and international recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLittle did they know that the same art festival would become one of the biggest and most celebrated art festivals in Sri Lanka. What started with just 30 artists has now increased to a number greater than 350. This art festival is what we now know to be Kala Pola.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe vibrant, colourful art festival, Kala Pola will return for its 26th run on February 24 at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha from 8am to 9pm. It is Sri Lanka’s biggest open art fair and provides a platform for aspiring and established artists to share,market and network themselves and their craft to local and international audiences; in 2018, there were 28,000 visitors and more than Rs.15 million worth of artworks were sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn the past, artists would be forced to book a gallery themselves and hold an exhibition to gain recognition. However, most of the time this was simply an additional financial burden and the artist would rarely gain any recognition as most visitors would simply be family and friends. Today at Kala Pola, it only costs Rs. 1000 to reserve a stall making it an affordable venture to display art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2019 marks 25 years of partnership between the George Keyt Foundation and John Keells Group to hold the Kala Pola annually. Representing the two organisations at a panel discussion on February 6, were Chairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings Nadija Tambiah, Vice President of John Keells Holdings Dileep Mudadeniya, artists Sudath Abeysekera and Zamshiya Kaleel. The discussion was moderated by Arun Dias Bandaranaike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tChairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, believes that Kala Pola has created a market for art in Sri Lanka and is now a ‘great launching pad for artists’.This is evident from the many artists who have gone on to gain international recognition. Sudath Abeysekera is one of artists whose art is now displayed in Bangladesh and India through the exposure he has received. He has participated in Kala Pola for 15 years and does not intend to stop as he says he has great respect for the event which has helped make him a full time artist. This thought has been reiterated by Zamshiya Kaleel who is also a veteran participant. She expressed her gratitude for the organisers as this was her way of making a living. The exposure and interest garnered through the fair has enabled her to do what she loves whilst providing for her family. Sh says, ‘we would eagerly await the day when the next Kala Pola was announced every year.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\tKala Pola has continued to evolve and is no longer simply a place to display and buy art; it has now also become a place of learning. Many schools and art students visit Kala Pola and talk to artists to further their understanding of how to create great artwork. There will also be a kids corner for children to tap into their creative side. This is a very positive development and one which Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings PLC, Nadija Tambiah, strongly supports as she believes that ‘the development of art is fundamental to the development of our culture’.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWith no entrance fee, Kala Pola 2019 is expected to demonstrate the best of Sri Lankan art for everyone to experience and enjoy.\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tThe Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC), in a bold step to reassure foreign investors, recently organized an Invest Sri Lanka Forum targeting portfolio and direct investors in Singapore. \n",

      "\t“The forum drew an encouraging response from investors, who were offered an assessment of the investment climate and expectations for the short-medium term, considering the context of the Easter Sunday attacks that took place on April 21,” the CSE said in a media release.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tInvestors also attended a number of one-to-one and group meetings with Sri Lankan listed companies that travelled to Singapore for the Invest Sri Lanka Initiative, which included Chairmen, Chief Executives and Senior Management representatives of John Keells Holdings PLC, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, Dialog Axiata PLC, Hemas Holdings PLC, Sampath Bank PLC, Peoples leasing and Finance PLC, National Development Bank PLC, Softlogic Holdings PLC, Softlogic life Insurance PLC and Sunshine Holdings PLC. \n",

      "\n",
      "\tThe State Minister of Finance speaking at the event acknowledged that the events on April 21 were a setback, but noted that all possible steps to ensure national security have been implemented during the past month, including apprehending elements that were responsible for the attacks. \n",
      "\tHe also said that Sri Lanka has witnessed overwhelming support internationally from foreign governments, institutions and the international community at-large, who have expressed solidarity with Sri Lanka during recovery and response efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe Central Bank Governor said that the fact that the robust macro-economic fundamentals which were evident before the crisis have remained intact post the tragic events offers reason to be optimistic on the ability of the economy to recuperate in the short-term. \n",
      "\tHe said while there will be a hit on growth, particularly due to the effects on the tourism sector and its supply chains, a large majority of the economy has remained completely untouched and unaffected by the events. “If you look at the economy, it is very much intact. So the capacity to bounce back is clear, if we can restore stability – and we have gone a long way towards doing that. If you take a medium-term view of Sri Lanka, the potential is enormous. We will get through these disturbances, as tragic as they were, and bounce back,” the Governor added. \n",

      "\tTwenty six years ago, 30 artists took part in an art festival. They would have hoped but may not have believed that this festival would lead to domestic and international recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLittle did they know that the same art festival would become one of the biggest and most celebrated art festivals in Sri Lanka. What started with just 30 artists has now increased to a number greater than 350. This art festival is what we now know to be Kala Pola.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe vibrant, colourful art festival, Kala Pola will return for its 26th run on February 24 at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha from 8am to 9pm. It is Sri Lanka’s biggest open art fair and provides a platform for aspiring and established artists to share,market and network themselves and their craft to local and international audiences; in 2018, there were 28,000 visitors and more than Rs.15 million worth of artworks were sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn the past, artists would be forced to book a gallery themselves and hold an exhibition to gain recognition. However, most of the time this was simply an additional financial burden and the artist would rarely gain any recognition as most visitors would simply be family and friends. Today at Kala Pola, it only costs Rs. 1000 to reserve a stall making it an affordable venture to display art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2019 marks 25 years of partnership between the George Keyt Foundation and John Keells Group to hold the Kala Pola annually. Representing the two organisations at a panel discussion on February 6, were Chairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings Nadija Tambiah, Vice President of John Keells Holdings Dileep Mudadeniya, artists Sudath Abeysekera and Zamshiya Kaleel. The discussion was moderated by Arun Dias Bandaranaike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tChairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, believes that Kala Pola has created a market for art in Sri Lanka and is now a ‘great launching pad for artists’.This is evident from the many artists who have gone on to gain international recognition. Sudath Abeysekera is one of artists whose art is now displayed in Bangladesh and India through the exposure he has received. He has participated in Kala Pola for 15 years and does not intend to stop as he says he has great respect for the event which has helped make him a full time artist. This thought has been reiterated by Zamshiya Kaleel who is also a veteran participant. She expressed her gratitude for the organisers as this was her way of making a living. The exposure and interest garnered through the fair has enabled her to do what she loves whilst providing for her family. Sh says, ‘we would eagerly await the day when the next Kala Pola was announced every year.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\tKala Pola has continued to evolve and is no longer simply a place to display and buy art; it has now also become a place of learning. Many schools and art students visit Kala Pola and talk to artists to further their understanding of how to create great artwork. There will also be a kids corner for children to tap into their creative side. This is a very positive development and one which Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings PLC, Nadija Tambiah, strongly supports as she believes that ‘the development of art is fundamental to the development of our culture’.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWith no entrance fee, Kala Pola 2019 is expected to demonstrate the best of Sri Lankan art for everyone to experience and enjoy.\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tTwenty six years ago, 30 artists took part in an art festival. They would have hoped but may not have believed that this festival would lead to domestic and international recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLittle did they know that the same art festival would become one of the biggest and most celebrated art festivals in Sri Lanka. What started with just 30 artists has now increased to a number greater than 350. This art festival is what we now know to be Kala Pola.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe vibrant, colourful art festival, Kala Pola will return for its 26th run on February 24 at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha from 8am to 9pm. It is Sri Lanka’s biggest open art fair and provides a platform for aspiring and established artists to share,market and network themselves and their craft to local and international audiences; in 2018, there were 28,000 visitors and more than Rs.15 million worth of artworks were sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn the past, artists would be forced to book a gallery themselves and hold an exhibition to gain recognition. However, most of the time this was simply an additional financial burden and the artist would rarely gain any recognition as most visitors would simply be family and friends. Today at Kala Pola, it only costs Rs. 1000 to reserve a stall making it an affordable venture to display art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2019 marks 25 years of partnership between the George Keyt Foundation and John Keells Group to hold the Kala Pola annually. Representing the two organisations at a panel discussion on February 6, were Chairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings Nadija Tambiah, Vice President of John Keells Holdings Dileep Mudadeniya, artists Sudath Abeysekera and Zamshiya Kaleel. The discussion was moderated by Arun Dias Bandaranaike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tChairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, believes that Kala Pola has created a market for art in Sri Lanka and is now a ‘great launching pad for artists’.This is evident from the many artists who have gone on to gain international recognition. Sudath Abeysekera is one of artists whose art is now displayed in Bangladesh and India through the exposure he has received. He has participated in Kala Pola for 15 years and does not intend to stop as he says he has great respect for the event which has helped make him a full time artist. This thought has been reiterated by Zamshiya Kaleel who is also a veteran participant. She expressed her gratitude for the organisers as this was her way of making a living. The exposure and interest garnered through the fair has enabled her to do what she loves whilst providing for her family. Sh says, ‘we would eagerly await the day when the next Kala Pola was announced every year.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\tKala Pola has continued to evolve and is no longer simply a place to display and buy art; it has now also become a place of learning. Many schools and art students visit Kala Pola and talk to artists to further their understanding of how to create great artwork. There will also be a kids corner for children to tap into their creative side. This is a very positive development and one which Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings PLC, Nadija Tambiah, strongly supports as she believes that ‘the development of art is fundamental to the development of our culture’.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWith no entrance fee, Kala Pola 2019 is expected to demonstrate the best of Sri Lankan art for everyone to experience and enjoy.\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tTwenty six years ago, 30 artists took part in an art festival. They would have hoped but may not have believed that this festival would lead to domestic and international recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLittle did they know that the same art festival would become one of the biggest and most celebrated art festivals in Sri Lanka. What started with just 30 artists has now increased to a number greater than 350. This art festival is what we now know to be Kala Pola.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe vibrant, colourful art festival, Kala Pola will return for its 26th run on February 24 at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha from 8am to 9pm. It is Sri Lanka’s biggest open art fair and provides a platform for aspiring and established artists to share,market and network themselves and their craft to local and international audiences; in 2018, there were 28,000 visitors and more than Rs.15 million worth of artworks were sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn the past, artists would be forced to book a gallery themselves and hold an exhibition to gain recognition. However, most of the time this was simply an additional financial burden and the artist would rarely gain any recognition as most visitors would simply be family and friends. Today at Kala Pola, it only costs Rs. 1000 to reserve a stall making it an affordable venture to display art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2019 marks 25 years of partnership between the George Keyt Foundation and John Keells Group to hold the Kala Pola annually. Representing the two organisations at a panel discussion on February 6, were Chairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings Nadija Tambiah, Vice President of John Keells Holdings Dileep Mudadeniya, artists Sudath Abeysekera and Zamshiya Kaleel. The discussion was moderated by Arun Dias Bandaranaike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tChairman of The George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz, believes that Kala Pola has created a market for art in Sri Lanka and is now a ‘great launching pad for artists’.This is evident from the many artists who have gone on to gain international recognition. Sudath Abeysekera is one of artists whose art is now displayed in Bangladesh and India through the exposure he has received. He has participated in Kala Pola for 15 years and does not intend to stop as he says he has great respect for the event which has helped make him a full time artist. This thought has been reiterated by Zamshiya Kaleel who is also a veteran participant. She expressed her gratitude for the organisers as this was her way of making a living. The exposure and interest garnered through the fair has enabled her to do what she loves whilst providing for her family. Sh says, ‘we would eagerly await the day when the next Kala Pola was announced every year.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\tKala Pola has continued to evolve and is no longer simply a place to display and buy art; it has now also become a place of learning. Many schools and art students visit Kala Pola and talk to artists to further their understanding of how to create great artwork. There will also be a kids corner for children to tap into their creative side. This is a very positive development and one which Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Holdings PLC, Nadija Tambiah, strongly supports as she believes that ‘the development of art is fundamental to the development of our culture’.\n",

      "\tWith no entrance fee, Kala Pola 2019 is expected to demonstrate the best of Sri Lankan art for everyone to experience and enjoy.\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",

      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",

      "\tAmidst fears of a hostile takeover, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) in a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said that they will repurchase their shares from the market, pumping in Rs.11 billion for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement said, \"The board resolved to offer to repurchase One (1) out of every Twenty (20) ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 160 per share, dates of which will be notified in due course.\" This came on the back of businessman Harry Jayawardena-related parties who started buying this share during the past few months, increased their purchases when foreigners sold, this past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJKH is the only major listed company that does not have a controlling shareholder. The Captains family owns some 19 per cent while nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by foreign institutions. During the past month most of the foreign funds were selling this share. Over the past few weeks JKH has been responsible for the bulk of foreign buying and selling in the market. Through his holding company Melstacorp, Businessman Harry Jayawardena related parties already own a 3.5 per cent in the conglomerate and analysts noted that he is open to buy more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe offer to repurchase shares reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares, the statement added. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast Friday JKH saw a net foreign selling of 3,958,050 shares.  Total shares traded in the company on Friday were 4,391,647 shares. These trades made JKH foreign ownership down to 51.1 per cent from 60 per cent earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe statement added, “the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the company’s planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.  With funding for the ongoing Cinnamon Life project fully secured, and funding in place for all planned investments across its core verticals over the next few years, JKH will continue to retain healthy cash reserves and the balance sheet flexibility, post the repurchase, to pursue further investment opportunities as they arise.” (DEC)\n",
